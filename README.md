Scalability and Flexibility - Software engineering ensures that software systems can adapt to changing requirements and the growth of user bases.  
Security - Software engineering incorporates security throughout the developing process and minimizes the risk of security breaches and the safety of system users.

2. Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

Mastering complexity - Large-scale software systems were developed in the 1960s and 1970s, adding new levels of complexity. New methods were created by software developers to deal with this complexity, including top-down design, structured programming, and modular programming.
Mastering process - Enhancing the software development process was the main goal of the 1980s and 1990s. As a result, software development approaches such as the V-model and waterfall were introduced. Frameworks for process improvement such as ISO9001 and CMM. Techniques for testing and quality assurance.
Mastering machine- Artificial intelligence, data storage, and processing power have all advanced significantly during the 2000s. Software engineers have created new methods to take advantage of these developments, including DevOps and cloud computing, AI and machine learning, and Big data analytics and data science.

3. List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle
   
Planning - Describe the objectives, deliverables, and scope of the project. Determine the users, stakeholders, and their needs. Create a project schedule, budget, and plan. Assess the project's viability.
Design - Develop an in-depth description of the software architecture. create user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) designs. Design the database schema and data storage. recognize and reduce possible security threats and risks.
Coding - Develop the code for the software program. Conduct unit testing and integration testing. Execute the database and data storage. install the development environment and tools.
Testing - Carry out various types of testing, such as functional testing, performance testing, security testing, and usability testing, and detect and rectify defects and bugs.

4. Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
   
Waterfall Methodology- Linear and sequential phases are completed one after the other, with no overlap. Predictive requirements are gathered upfront, and the project plan is created accordingly. Documentation-based detailed documentation is created at each phase, which serves as a guide for the next phase.
Scenarios for waterfall- Safety-critical systems where predictability and reliability are most important. Regulated industries where there is a requirement for strict compliance with regulations and standards. Well-defined requirements are stable, clear, and unlikely to change.

Agile Methodology- The Iterative and incremental phases are cycled through repeatedly, with ongoing improvement. Adaptive needs are gathered and refined throughout the project, with scope for variation. Collaboration-focused cross-functional teams work together with frequent communication and feedback.
Scenarios for Agile- Experimental or novel project where requirements are unpredictable or likely to be changing, as in startups and R&D. Fast prototyping where there's a need for fast feedback and iteration. Dynamic or complex systems where adaptability and flexibility are essential, such as cybersecurity or artificial intelligence.
